# MySkills

> A modular, conditionally loaded skill library for systems programming, GPU compute, graphics, operating systems, compilers, model formats, LLM infrastructure, debugging, and production code quality.

## Authoritative engineering guide

For the complete engine architecture, module contracts, backend and memory policies, GGUF/SafeTensors boundaries, lazy loading, KV-cache design, CLI/API usage, probe-bus tracing, validation gates, and human/AI contribution workflow, start with [`ENGINEERING_GUIDE.md`](ENGINEERING_GUIDE.md). This is the integrated source-of-truth guide that goes with the skill sources.

The repository is designed for **progressive disclosure**. Skill metadata is used for routing; a skill body is loaded only when its trigger matches the active task; detailed procedures and version matrices live in on-demand references. This keeps unrelated domain knowledge out of context and reduces token consumption.

## Design principles

The suite follows five rules. First, load the smallest specialist that matches the active boundary. Second, add another skill only when the task crosses a concrete API, ABI, memory, kernel, compiler, graphics, or model-format boundary. Third, keep shared workflows in `_systems-ml-shared/` rather than copying them into every skill. Fourth, never present a placeholder, stub, fake success path, demo-only branch, or unverified claim as production functionality. Fifth, record version, host, target, toolchain, and validation evidence for time-sensitive work.

## Loading model

| Level | What is loaded | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Metadata | One concise `name` and `description` per skill | Route without loading implementation detail |
| Skill body | The matching `SKILL.md` only | Provide the minimum repeatable workflow |
| Reference | A named file only when its topic is active | Hold version tables, API notes, checklists, and detailed variants |

Use `systems-ml-stack-router` only when a request spans several domains or its boundary is unclear. Do not load the entire suite for a single C++, CUDA, Linux, or model-format task.

The configured auto-trigger skills are `debug-core`, `dev-process`, `dox-validate`, `traceability`, `context-tracker`, `knowledge-base`, and `analysis-log`. All domain, quality, and specialized debugging skills are conditional. The configuration is in [`opencode.jsonc`](opencode.jsonc).

## Canonical skill catalog

The repository contains **66 canonical skills**. Existing skills that overlapped the new compact modules were replaced rather than duplicated; the mapping is documented in [Canonical migrations](#canonical-migrations).

### Debugging

| Skill | Load when | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `debug-core` | Any software failure | Evidence-first reproduce, localize, fix, verify, regress loop |
| `debug-domain-router` | A failure needs domain interpretation | Select one domain skill without preloading all domains |
| `debug-reproduce` | The failure is not reliably reproducible | Capture and minimize a deterministic reproducer |
| `debug-localize` | The first wrong boundary is unknown | Bisect input, state, transformation, and output |

### AMD and NVIDIA GPU stacks

| Skill | Load when | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `rocm-stack` | ROCm/HIP libraries, profiling, or AMD GPU optimization | HIP, rocBLAS, RCCL, rocprof, rocminfo, packaging |
| `rocr-runtime` | ROCr/HSA runtime behavior | Agents, queues, AQL, signals, memory pools, code objects |

For ROCm, ROCr, Vulkan, DirectX/Agility, DirectML, and RDNA version work, load `_systems-ml-shared/version-policy.md` first. It requires separating packaged releases, component Git tags, preview/nightly streams, drivers, SDKs, and hardware support instead of assuming that related version numbers are interchangeable.

## Canonical migrations

The following legacy names were removed as duplicate packages. Their strongest shared behavior is now maintained under the canonical modular skill; use the mapping when updating external references.

| Removed duplicate | Canonical skill |
|---|---|
| `c99-standards` | `c99-systems` |
| `cuda-optimization` | `cuda-stack` |
| `directx-compute` | `directx-ai-ml` |
| `gguf-ggml` | `gguf-format` |
| `rocm-hip` | `rocm-stack` |
| `rocr-core` | `rocr-runtime` |
| `safetensors-handler` | `safetensors-format` |
| `shader-opt` | `graphics-shader-kernels` when the task is broader than optimization |
| `windows-systems` | `windows-system-architecture` |
| `x86-assembly` | `assembler` when the task is general assembly/ABI work |
| `cpp-modern` | `cpp-systems` when the task is production systems C++ rather than language-only guidance |

Specialized non-duplicates such as `cdna`, `rdna`, `vulkan-compute`, `linux-systems`, `os-kernel`, `python-performance`, and the engine-specific skills remain separate because they have distinct trigger boundaries.

## Quality gate against false or incomplete code

`implementation-integrity` is conditional on code-writing tasks. It requires an explicit behavior contract, a search for TODO/FIXME/placeholder/stub/fake-success paths, a complete implementation, and executed evidence. A report must distinguish **PASS**, **FAIL**, **NOT RUN**, and **UNVALIDATED**. Comments do not replace implementation, and a demo path must never be silently used as a production path.

`code-contract-comments` documents only non-obvious behavior: preconditions, postconditions, ownership, lifetime, errors, side effects, synchronization, and performance constraints. `modular-component-boundaries` and `backend-component-demarcation` make component seams explicit so backends, workers, repositories, and platform adapters can be added, removed, or ported without spreading conditionals through unrelated code.

## Shared references and deduplication

The `_systems-ml-shared/` directory is intentionally not a skill and must never auto-load. Read only the named file when needed:

| Reference | Read only for |
|---|---|
| `shared-execution-protocol.md` | General implementation workflow and evidence labels |
| `quality-gates.md` | Completeness and anti-placeholder checks |
| `version-policy.md` | Release, preview, compatibility, or support claims |
| `porting-checklist.md` | Cross-platform behavior and capability mapping |
| `model-format-checklist.md` | Binary model artifact validation |
| `suite-manifest.md` | Bundle inventory and loading policy |

## Installation and use

The repository layout is directly discoverable by OpenCode: each skill is a directory containing `SKILL.md` at the repository root. Preserve the root layout when copying or extracting the repository into the OpenCode skills directory. Keep `_systems-ml-shared/` beside the skill directories so explicitly referenced files remain available without becoming auto-triggered skills.

Example calls are intentionally small:

```text
skill("cuda-stack")
skill("implementation-integrity")
skill("gguf-format")
skill("backend-component-demarcation")
```

For a cross-domain request, start with `systems-ml-stack-router`; do not manually load all domain modules.

## Validation

Validate every `SKILL.md` with the project’s skill validator or the local skill validator available in the execution environment. Also check that every configured skill name exists, every `name` matches its directory, no initializer examples remain, and the JSON configuration parses after comments are removed. For implementation changes, run the narrowest relevant build or test and report anything not executed.

## Contributing a skill

Create one narrowly triggered directory with a concise `SKILL.md`. Put version matrices, long API references, examples, and platform variants under a reference file. Keep the body below roughly 180 words when practical, avoid duplicating shared rules, state when another skill should be loaded, and never include fake or placeholder production code. Add the skill to `opencode.jsonc` only as conditional unless it is genuinely useful for nearly every task. Update the README catalog and migration table when names change.
